# TRV Website Development (Discontinued)
This project was about creating a website for a research community that no longer exists.

The project has been shared on Github so people can learn from it, you are free to distribute, share and make changes to this code. You don't necessary need to pass the credit to me but there is nothing to stop you from doing so. 

I would love to hear from you, please let me know about tips, tricks and methodologies you think I should use; besides that if you would like to start and maintain such a community, you are free to do so.
