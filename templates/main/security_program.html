      <h1><strong>Responsible Disclosure</h1>
      <p>In the valley, we believe that the security of our systems, our network and our users is very important.
        We pay a lot of attention to this during development and maintenance. However, sometimes vulnerabilities escape detection.
        We appreciate you notifying us if you find one. We would prefer to hear about it as soon as possible so that we can take measures to protect our customers.<br>
        <br>
        This document describes the procedure we have prepared for this.
      </p>

      <h2>Reporting</h2>
      <p>If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us at security@researchersvalley.org.</p>
      <p>To help streamline our intake process, we ask that submissions include:
        <ol>
          <li>Description of the vulnerability</li>
          <li>eps to reproduce the reported vulnerability</li>
          <li>oof of exploitability (e.g. screenshot, video)</li>
          <li>rceived impact to another user or the organization</li>
          <li>Proposed CVSSv3 Vector & Score (without environmental and temporal modifiers)</li>
          <li>List of URLs and affected parameters</li>
          <li>Other vulnerable URLs, additional payloads, Proof-of-Concept code</li>
          <li>Browser, OS and/or app version used during testing</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h2>Rules of Engagement</h2>
      <p>By submitting reports or otherwise participating in this program,
        you agree that you have read and will follow the Program Rules and Legal Terms sections of this program Policy.
        <ol>
          <li>Test vulnerabilities only against accounts that you own or accounts that you have permission from the account holder to test against.</li>
          <li>Never use a finding to compromise/exfiltrate data or pivot to other systems. Use a proof of concept only to demonstrate an issue.</li>
          <li>If sensitive information--such as personal information, credentials, etc.--is accessed as part of a vulnerability,
            it must not be saved, stored, transferred, accessed, or otherwise processed after initial discovery.
            All copies of sensitive information must be returned to TRV team and may not be retained.</li>
          <li>Abide by the program scope. Only reports submitted to this program and against assets in scope will be eligible for hall of fame.</li>
          <li>Researchers may not publicly disclose vulnerabilities (sharing any details whatsoever with anyone other than authorized TRV team).</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

    <h2>Vulnerability Scope</h2>
    <p>Our program scope is like nothing you have seen before, our community is focused on hacking as much as it's focused towards development.
    This is one of the reasons we actually accept ANY type of vulnerability, by ANY, we mean all these vulnerabilities/flaws/bugs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>DoS/DDoS</li>
      <li>Social Engineering</li>
      <li>Text/HTML Injection</li>
      <li>Self XSS</li>
      <li>Clickjacking</li>
      <li>Login/Logout CSRF</li>
      <li>Missing HTTP security headers</li>
      <li>Brute force / rate-limit bypass</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Please keep in mind that you need to describe how you can damage us with any of these, even if you find a text injection 'flaw', you
    would need to perform an attack and explain how it can damage our members.
    Our members are usually developers or bug hunters just like you but anyone can make mistakes, try to social engineer us, gather data about us,
    possibilities are limitless.<br><br>
    Go on with the BlackHat mindset, remember that most of hacks in the history happened because people didn't care about out-of-scope flaws, such as social engineering.
